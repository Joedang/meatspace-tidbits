# Designs meant for a laser-cutter
Most/all of these designs were intended for the laser cutter I used as PSU. 
Cut and engrave lines are specified with 0.002 in red and blue lines, respectively, so you may have a tough time viewing them.
You may also need to convert them to a different file format. I recommend Inkscape (free, open, cross-platform) for the SVGs (both viewing and converting). 
I'll try to make any SolidWorks-native designs available in both SLDDRW and something more interoperable. 

The designs are sorted by intended material thickness. I usually design laser-cut parts for tab-slot assembly, so it matters what material thickness you use.
